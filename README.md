## CSE 163 Project

In order to run this project, you must install the following libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
seaborn
matplotlib
I ran all my code in VSCode, using a conda virtual environment. The project should include all sets of data, but will need adjustment in order to account for the difference in path, as I was unsure of how to encode it in. Otherwise, the project should be fine to run, as long as you run CSE163FinalData.py first!
